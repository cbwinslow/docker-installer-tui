# GitHub Setup Instructions

The GitHub repository has been created at: https://github.com/cbwinslow/docker-installer-tui

## To Complete the GitHub Upload

Since this was run in an environment that doesn't support interactive authentication, you'll need to complete the upload manually:

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. Generate a Personal Access Token on GitHub:
   - Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)
   - Click "Generate new token"
   - Select appropriate scopes (at minimum `repo` scope)
   - Copy the generated token

2. Set up git with the token:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://<token>@github.com/cbwinslow/docker-installer-tui.git
   ```

3. Push the code:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 2: GitHub CLI Authentication

1. Authenticate using the GitHub CLI:
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```
   Follow the prompts to authenticate

2. Push the code:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 3: SSH Key Authentication

1. Set up SSH keys with GitHub:
   - Generate an SSH key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "blaine.winslow@gmail.com"`
   - Add the SSH key to your GitHub account
   - Change the remote URL:
