## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Shell Script Execution in test_system.py ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: Test was failing to execute shell scripts via subprocess  
**Root Cause**: Scripts were being called directly without bash interpreter  
**Fix Applied**: Added bash prefix to subprocess.run() calls  
**Lines Changed**: 2 sections in test_system.py  
**Result**: All system tests now pass successfully

### 2. Missing main() Function in DockerInstallerTUI.py ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: No main() function defined for entry point  
**Root Cause**: Code was calling app directly in if __name__ block  
**Fix Applied**: 
- Added proper main() function
- Updated if __name__ block to call main()
- Ensures entry points work correctly for package installation  
**Result**: Module can now be imported and called properly

### 3. Incomplete Makefile Targets ✅ ENHANCED

**Issue**: Makefile lacked comprehensive targets and good defaults  
**Improvements Made**:
- Added `all` target as default (install + test)
- New test targets: test-all, test-comprehensive, test-tui, test-installation
- Enhanced clean target with thorough cleanup (pyc, pyo, cache dirs)
- Improved dist target with validation step
- Better help documentation
- More informative output messages with status indicators
- Error checking for optional tools (flake8, twine)

### 4. Incorrect GitHub URLs ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: Package files referenced placeholder GitHub URLs  
**Files Updated**: pyproject.toml, setup.py  
**Fix Applied**: Updated all URLs to correct repository (cbwinslow/docker-installer-tui)  
**Result**: Package metadata now correctly references the actual repository
